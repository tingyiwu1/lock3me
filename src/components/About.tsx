                The Lockhart Institute was founded by Dr. Alexandria Lockhart in 1932, and its<br/>
                adjoining Research branch was added in 1935. Since then, it has undergone<br/>
                considerable changes due to its rapid expansion. Its most dramatic development<br/>
                occurred in 1961, when the prison was reconstructed into a public school for funding<br/>
                purposes. Experimentation has continued in the Research branch, which was<br/>
                refurbished into the schoolâ€™s newest building in 2016. All operations continue as<br/>
                normal. <Hd>ASHES ASHES ASHES ASHES ASHES ASHES ASHES ASHES ASHES</Hd><br/>
