                The Lockhart Institute’s Research branch is dedicated to improving the lives of<br/>
                humankind through relentless experimentation and innovation. All our researchers<br/>
                subscribe to a firm belief in utilitarianism, and we strive to produce results that<br/>
                maximize the benefits for the greatest number of people. Currently, our team’s focus<br/>
                is on designing the perfect human to serve as a model for society.<Hd> ASHES ASHES</Hd><br/>
